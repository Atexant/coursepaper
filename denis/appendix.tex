Результаты вычислительного эксперимента для~алгоритма комплексного анализа 
близости предложений.
Для сравнения даны оценки близости представленных пар предложений людьми, 
результаты работы алгоритма и условная погрешность его работы, как модуль разности между этими оценками.
Достоверность оценок близости, данных людьми, равна 0,95. Достоверность для~оценок,
данных алгоритмом, а также для условной погрешности его работы равна 0,999995 и 0,95 соответственно.
